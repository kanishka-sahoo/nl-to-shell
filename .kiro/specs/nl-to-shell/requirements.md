# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a command-line utility that converts natural language descriptions into executable shell commands using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system provides context-aware command generation by analyzing the current working directory, git repository state, files, and other environmental factors. It emphasizes safety through dangerous command detection, user confirmation prompts, and validation systems while supporting multiple AI providers and cross-platform compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a command-line user, I want to describe what I want to do in natural language and get the appropriate shell command, so that I don't need to remember complex command syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides natural language input THEN the system SHALL generate an appropriate shell command that fulfills the user's intent
2. WHEN the user inputs "List files by size in descending order" THEN the system SHALL generate a command equivalent to `ls -lS`
3. WHEN the user provides ambiguous requests THEN the system SHALL generate commands using best-effort interpretation
4. WHEN the system generates a command THEN it SHALL support common command-line operations and utilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to understand my project context (git status, file types, etc.) so that it generates more relevant commands for my current situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating commands THEN the system SHALL analyze the current working directory context
2. WHEN in a git repository THEN the system SHALL include current branch name and working tree status in context
3. WHEN analyzing the environment THEN the system SHALL gather available files and directories (with performance limits)
4. WHEN context plugins are available THEN the system SHALL load and utilize plugin-provided context data
5. WHEN repository state is detected THEN the system SHALL incorporate git information into command generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with API access, I want to configure my preferred AI provider and model, so that I can use the service that works best for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring providers THEN the system SHALL support OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Ollama
2. WHEN using cloud providers THEN the system SHALL authenticate using API keys
3. WHEN using Ollama THEN the system SHALL support local or remote HTTP access without API keys
4. WHEN multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow configurable default models per provider
5. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL support runtime provider and model override capability
6. WHEN provider errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement fallback and error handling mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cautious user, I want to see what command will be executed before it runs, so that I can prevent accidental harmful operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN potentially dangerous commands are detected THEN the system SHALL identify operations like file deletion, system modification, and system control commands
2. WHEN dangerous commands are generated THEN the system SHALL require explicit user approval before execution
3. WHEN users request it THEN the system SHALL provide a dry run mode to preview commands without execution
4. WHEN advanced users configure it THEN the system SHALL allow bypassing confirmation prompts
5. WHEN protected operations are detected THEN the system SHALL protect against `rm`, `rmdir`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `shutdown`, `reboot`, and `halt` commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate command execution results and provide automatic correction when commands fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is generated THEN the system SHALL execute the initial command and capture results
2. WHEN command execution completes THEN the system SHALL validate results against user intent using AI
3. WHEN commands fail THEN the system SHALL generate corrected commands for failed executions
4. WHEN corrections are generated THEN the system SHALL re-execute with the same safety protections
5. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear user feedback on validation results with success/failure indication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my provider credentials and preferences to be persistently stored and easily configurable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing configuration THEN the system SHALL use standard system locations for configuration files
2. WHEN multiple providers are used THEN the system SHALL support simultaneous configuration of all providers
3. WHEN first-time users run the system THEN the system SHALL provide interactive setup
4. WHEN runtime overrides are needed THEN the system SHALL allow configuration overrides during execution
5. WHEN configuration is stored THEN it SHALL include default provider selection, credentials, default models, and user preferences

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to automatically update itself, so that I always have the latest features and security fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL perform periodic background update availability checks
2. WHEN users request updates THEN the system SHALL support manual update installation
3. WHEN checking for updates THEN the system SHALL provide check-only mode without installation
4. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL handle platform-specific update mechanisms
5. WHEN installing updates THEN the system SHALL provide backup and recovery capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to run multiple commands in sequence without restarting the tool, so that I can work efficiently in extended sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in session mode THEN the system SHALL accept multiple sequential commands in one session
2. WHEN processing multiple commands THEN the system SHALL maintain configuration and context between commands
3. WHEN entering and exiting sessions THEN the system SHALL provide clear session entry and exit mechanisms
4. WHEN individual commands fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors without terminating the entire session

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a command-line user, I want comprehensive command-line interface options for different use cases and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users need safety verification THEN the system SHALL provide optional dry run preview mode
2. WHEN flexibility is needed THEN the system SHALL support runtime model and provider selection override
3. WHEN advanced users work THEN the system SHALL allow confirmation bypass for efficiency
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide verbose output for detailed information display
5. WHEN support is needed THEN the system SHALL display software version information
6. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL provide update management commands
7. WHEN performance control is needed THEN the system SHALL allow optional result validation control
8. WHEN productivity is important THEN the system SHALL support continuous session operation mode

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the system with custom context providers through a plugin system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugins are available THEN the system SHALL support custom context providers
2. WHEN managing plugins THEN the system SHALL use registry-based plugin management
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL perform runtime plugin discovery and loading
4. WHEN plugin errors occur THEN the system SHALL isolate plugin errors from core functionality
5. WHEN plugins provide context THEN they SHALL support environment variables, custom tool detection, project-specific context, and language-specific information

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user on different operating systems, I want the tool to work consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying on Linux THEN the system SHALL support x86_64 and ARM64 architectures
2. WHEN deploying on macOS THEN the system SHALL support Intel x86_64 and Apple Silicon ARM64
3. WHEN deploying on Windows THEN the system SHALL support x86_64 architecture
4. WHEN distributing the software THEN the system SHALL provide automated installer scripts and direct binary downloads
5. WHEN users prefer compilation THEN the system SHALL support source code compilation and package manager integration where applicable
